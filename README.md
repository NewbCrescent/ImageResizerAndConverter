# ImageResizerAndConverter

***How it Works:*** You get asked a series of questions relating to your images, and it converts and resizes your images easily.

***Required:*** Install the Pillow library
```
pip install Pillow
```
***optional:*** Install "pillow-avif-plugin" and the "pillow-jxl-plugin" for support for avif and jxl images. Import them to the top of the program and that's it.
```
pip install pillow-avif-plugin
```
```
pip install pillow-jxl-plugin
```
